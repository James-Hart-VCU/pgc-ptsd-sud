# pgc-ptsd-sud
This repository serves as a central location for all code relevant to the PGC-PTSD &amp; SUD workgroup; Including but not limited to cleaning, harmonization, and analysis pipelines and scripts. When code is ready for publication, it will be commited to the "publish" branch, otherwise create a new branch when writing new code and commit progress to the "develop" branch. 

PROJECT NARRATIVE The overarching goal of this proposal is to understand the genetic relationships between Substance Use Disorders (SUD, i.e., alcohol, nicotine, cannabis, opioid) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) while increasing representation of individuals of diverse ancestry in psychiatric genetics research. The immense framework of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) will be used to allow for scientific collaboration, phenotypic harmonization across thousands of participants through the PGC-PTSD and PGC-SUD workgroups, and for building upon the success of each group in ancestral diversity. This research will increase understanding of the etiology of PTSD and SUD, informing prevention and intervention efforts tailored to those with co-occurring PTSD and SUDs and moreover will increase inclusion of individuals of African and Latinx descent in large-scale genome-wide association studies.
